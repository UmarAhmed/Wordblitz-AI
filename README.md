Given a 4 x 4 grid of English letters, we want to find all paths that are English letters

A path is a sequence of letters which are adjacent (left, right, up, down, diagonals). No cell from the grid can be used in a path more than once. 

We solve this problem by traversing the graph, and then automating play. 

The program accepts four words representing the four rows of the grid. The program then plays the game.
